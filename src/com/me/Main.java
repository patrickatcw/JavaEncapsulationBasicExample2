/*
- create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques
- the class will be called printer, it will simulate a real computer printer
- it should have fields for the toner level, number of pages printed,
and also whether it's a duplex printer(capable of printing on both sides of the paper)
- add methods to fill up the toner (up to a max. of 100%), and another
method to simulate printing a page (which should increase the number
of pages printed)
- decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think
is needed (remember scope is determining when the code is compiled, order)
